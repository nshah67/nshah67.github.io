        <p align=justify> I am a research associate at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health working on the Kilkari Impact Evaluation. Kilkari is a national audio messaging program that has been rolled out in 12 states of India. As part of this impact evaluation, we are conducting a randomized control trial enrolling 5000 pregnant women and examining the impact of the content of the messages on knowledge and practice of certain maternal health-related behaviors. </p>
